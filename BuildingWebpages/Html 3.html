	Images
	
	Websites, nowadays, are a lot more than text and links. Media of every type has been included in a webpage one way or another. The most popular, images, have been around for a long time and don't look like they're leaving any time soon. Included in this page is an example of how different types of media are included in a webpage.
	
	1. after the closing </img> tag, add an opening and closing <video> tag
		<video></video>
		
	2. inside of the opening video tag, add 'controls'
		<video controls></video>
		this just tells the browser to let the user control the video (play/pause/volume/etc)
		
	3. inside of the <video> tag, add a opening and closing <source> tag.
		<video controls>
			<source></source>
		</video>
		
	4. add a src attribute with the value "SweetVictory.mp4" to the opening source tag
		<video controls>
			<source src="SweetVictory.mp4">
			</source>
		</video>
		
	Music and audio is supported in the same way. If you want to add a song to your webpage, just replace 'video' with 'audio' and everything should just work.
