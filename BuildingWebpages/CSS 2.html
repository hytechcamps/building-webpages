<!--
	Style this webpage!
	
	This webpage has 3 pictures of cats on it (aww!). The owner wants us to make the picture bigger when we put our mouse over the picture.
	We can do this with css! 
	
	Some notes before you start working:
		* The tag used to add images is the <img> tag. Similar to <a>, the <img> tag has a 'src' attribute (like <a>'s 'href' that points to a picture.
		* You can ignore most of the other styling. That is there to make the page more presentable. Feel free to read it over and ask questions though!
	
	1. inside the '{}' of 'img:hover' add a new 'height' and 'width' with a larger size. Try 150px!. Refer to the 'img' style to see how to do that. 
		px stands for pixels.
		'img:hover' means "style 'img' whenever someone 'hovers' their mouse over that element.". In our case, whenever we mouse over the cats (get it?)
	2. Save the page and try it!.
	
	The owner of the site likes that the cats get larger but thinks that it snaps into place too quickly. Let's try animating it with 'transition'.
	
	1. inside of the '{}' of 'img' add the following line: 'transition: height 1s, width 1s;'
		'transition' tells your browser that if any of the specified properties change they should be animated. 
		The format of 'transition' is as follows:
			transition: <property you want animated> <how long is the animation>;
		
		You can animate multiple properties if you use a comma like we did:
			transition: <property 1> <time 1>, <property 2> <time 2>, <property 3> <time 3>, ... ;
	
		You can animate tons of properties like color, size, rotation, opacity (how transparent an element is)
