	Creating your personal contact page!
	
	Let's make something a little more complex. How about a personal contact page so people know how they can contact you?
	
	1. Replace "My Name" with your name
	2. Adjust the Phone and Email values with your phone number and email address. 
	3. Add additional '<li>' tags for other ways to contact you. Examples: Physical address, PO box, other email addresses, fax number
		<ul> stands for 'Unorganized List' and shows a bullet point list of items
		<li> stands for 'List Item' and represents a single item in a list. You can put anything in here including images, links, and more lists!
		
	4. Add a <p> tag after </h1> and give a quick description of yourself. <p> stands for paragraph and is used for paragraphs of text.
		<p>This is my personal contact page!</p>
		
	5. After the paragraph tag containing the text 'My Favorite Websites:', add an open and close <ol> tag.
		<ol> means Organized List and will show numbers instead of bullet points. It's written just like <ul>.
	6. Add 5 <li> open and close tags inside of the newly created <ol> tag
		<ol>
			<li></li>
			<li></li>
			<li></li>
			<li></li>
			<li></li>
		</ol>
		
	7. In each <li> tag, add an <a> tag that links to one of your top 5 favorite websites. (I like google, reddit, stackoverflow, facebook, and developer.android.com)
		<a> means Anchor and it creates links that you can click on to get to other pages.
		This is what an <a> tag looks like:         <a href="the address of the website">The text you want to be clickable</a>
		Example anchor tag that goes to google.com: <a href="http://www.google.com">Click here to go to Google.com!</a>
