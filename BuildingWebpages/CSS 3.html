	CSS Classes
	
	CSS has this concept of a "class" which is basically just another way to identify an element in your html.
	We can use classes to style any number of elements of various kinds.
	To specify that a particular html tag have a class, add: class="classname"
	
	1. Add 3-5 img tags inside of the <div>
		Make sure to set the src attribute to point to some pictures on google images.
		The <div> tag stands for "division" and is used to separate out sections of a webpage into "divisions" or sections. Here, we're grouping all of the images into a single section we can then style later.
	2. Add the small class to some of the images and add the large class to the rest of the images.
		<img src="http://www.example.com/someimage.jpg" class="small"></img>
	3. Check your work and make sure that the images that you set as small are small and the large ones are large.
	4. Add a class to the div named 'images'
	5. Add an entry in your css for 'images'
		Note: when styling a class, the name starts with a period.
		.smaller
		.larger
		.images
	6. under '.images', add a 30px padding. This will get our images away from the side of the screen which looks a little better.
		Padding is the space that "pads" the contents of an element from the edges of the container
		
		|----------|
		| some txt |
		| in this  |
		| element  |
		|__________|

		Notice how the text doesn't touch the side of the box? That space between the text and the box is called padding.
		
		padding: 4px;
		
	7. Let's add a margin to the img tag so that they are separated a little.
		Margin is like padding except it adds spacing to the outside of an element, not the inside.
		
		|----------|
		|          |
		|          |
		|__________|
		
(this space here is margin)
		
		|----------|
		|          |
		|          |
		|__________|
		
		margin: 10px;
	
	8. Add a neat effect when you hover over large images. (remember :hover)
