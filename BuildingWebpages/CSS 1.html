	Style this webpage!
	
	CSS makes boring sites, awesome. It can color, rotate, animate, and align your page in just the right way to make it stand out.
	Let's try changing this page to have some color, larger text, and better looking font!
	
	1. Look for the <style> tag. On the line that says "background: white;", change 'white' to the name of another color you want the background to be.
		'background' sets the background image or color of an element. You can use a url, name of a color, or a hex code to describe the specific color you want. (#ff0000 = RED)
	2. Let's make the font a little bigger in the list since it seems small compared to the title. Inside of curly braces after 'li', add 'font-size: larger;'
		'font-size' does what its name suggests and adjusts the size of the text. You can say larger or smaller,
			specific sizes like 20px, or even percentages like 120% to get a particular size that you desire.
	3. Finally, let's not use the nasty default font any more. After the background property, add 'font-family: *font*;'
		replace *font* with one of the following (if there are quotes, include them this time): "Lucida Sans Unicode", "Arial", Impact
	4. Let's color the list! Add 'color: red;' to the 'li' style. Feel free to change the color to something else that looks better.
	5. Save everything, refresh, and see your handy-work!
