<!--
	What is a website?
		-At it's core, it's just a text file with some simple code tags in it
		-All websites have a structure made up of:
		--HTML tags
		---Head 
		---Body
		---Misc
		-Your browser reads these tags and displays the page to you.
		
	Creating your first webpage!
	
	NOTE: Almost all tags have an opening (<body>) and a close (</body>)
		the difference is that the close tag has a '/' in front of the name.
	
	1. Inside of the body tag of this page add an open and close tag for '<h1>'.
		This stands for 'Heading 1' and is generally used for titles.
	2. In between '<h1></h1>', write 'Hello, World' without the single quotes.
	3. Now just save this page and right click on the file and select Open in Other Browser to open it in chrome.
