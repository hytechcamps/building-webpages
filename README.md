# Building Webpages
Content for the Building Webpages Hy-Tech Camp

## Overview
This camp introduces HTML and CSS mostly through individual activities. There is a brief explanation of the web, and then there are activities. The students will complete the activities, and then the instructors will go over them. There are also Kahoot quizzes to punctuate the sections of the camp.

Instructors should compress the [BuildingWebpages](BuildingWebpages/) folder into a zipped folder, and allow the students to download the zip file. The whole camp will run through the [BuildingWebpages](BuildingWebpages.pptx) presentation.
