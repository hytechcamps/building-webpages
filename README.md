# Building Websites with HTML & CSS
Content for the Building Webpages Hy-Tech Camp

## Description
In this workshop, students will explore the inner workings of the World Wide Web, and then create their own webpages. They will use HTML to add text and pictures to their pages, and CSS to update fonts, colors, and more. By the end of the workshop, they will have gained a basic understanding of web development, and each student will have a totally unique website of their own design.

## Videos
There are videos for the camp here:

- [Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH4FsGZ4xcs)
- [Code-Along](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4drNo8aTPsQ)

## Icebreaker
Have students create a color scheme using [coolors](https://coolors.co). After a few minutes, allow students to introduce themselves and share their color schemes. They will be able to use the colors they generate during the activity if desired.

## Lecture
Start by showing students how to view the source of a webpage - go to a page like [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog), right click, and select the "View page source" option.

After that, present the [PowerPoint Presentation](HelloHtml.pptx). The PowerPoint includes a brief introduction to the topics covered by the code-along activity.

## Code-Along
Walk through the [code-along](CodeAlong.md) instructions.

## Kahoot
At the end of the code-along, if there is time, play through the [Kahoot quiz](https://create.kahoot.it/share/duplicate-of-basic-html-css-activities-quiz/bacfd57b-72ff-4802-8cc7-caf098c9dd27).

## Individual Work and Sharing Sites
After the Kahoot, give students an opportunity to work independently, and share their sites. Prioritize sharing sites - there should be at least 5-10 minutes at the end for anyone to share.

If there is time at the end, before sharing sites, go over some of the [additional topics](https://hylandtechoutreach.github.io/coding-activities/HtmlCssJsContinued/AdditionalTopicChallenges.html). Show students how to embed a YouTube video, or some of the other CSS properties they can change.

If there is nothing else to do and the students are not active, feel free to end the workshop early.
